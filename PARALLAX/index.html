      <h2>REMYA SUCKS</h2>
      <p>
        Good morning everyone,
        Valuation completed Last week. The questions were not that easy, but there were questions which can get you above 50 marks. 
        Pass percentage is pretty good which i didn't expect.. happy to see that many of you have worked hard and tried your best. 
        Really felt happy to see one of you scored 97 marks for this paper and i don't know who is that. Once the results published, please meet me.  There were more than 10 students who scored above 80 marks. That was an amazing score which is the actual outcome of this subject.
        Thank you for the coorperation and hard work from everyone. If i scolded anyone for anything, please don't keep it personal, it's to mould you to a better professional student.
        Best wishes for the upcoming semester. My advise is please don't completely stick on to the class notes or ppt.. read the textbooks which will definitely help you in your career growth.

        If you need any help / support please feel free to approach me. 

        Thank you
        Best wishes
        Dr. Remya Jayachandran
